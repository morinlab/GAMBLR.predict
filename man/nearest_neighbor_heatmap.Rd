\title{Heatmap visualization of mutations in nearest neighbors for a sample}
\usage{
nearest_neighbor_heatmap(
  this_sample_id,
  single_sample_prediction_output,
  optimized_model,
  truth_column = "lymphgen",
  pred_column,
  clustering_distance = "binary",
  metadata_cols = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{this_sample_id}{Character. The sample ID for which to plot the nearest neighbor heatmap.}

\item{single_sample_prediction_output}{A list containing the prediction results from predict_single_sample_DLBCLone,
including the feature matrix and predictions.}

\item{optimized_model}{list of parameters from DLBCLone_optimize_params, neccessary UMAP output from a
previous, Data frame with the best parameters. useful for reproducibility.}

\item{truth_column}{Character. The column name in the predictions data frame that contains the ground truth labels (default: "lymphgen").}

\item{pred_column}{Character. The column name in the predictions data frame that contains the predicted labels.}

\item{clustering_distance}{Character. The distance metric to use for clustering rows. Default is "binary".}

\item{metadata_cols}{Optional character vector of additional metadata columns to include in the heatmap annotations.}
}
\value{
A ComplexHeatmap object showing the feature matrix for the nearest neighbors of the sample.
}
\description{
Generates a heatmap of feature values for the nearest neighbors of a specified sample,
based on a DLBCLone model object. This visualization helps to inspect the feature profiles
of samples most similar to the query sample.
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item For models of type \code{DLBCLone_optimize_params}, uses the \code{neighbors} and \code{lyseq_status} fields.
\item For models of type \code{DLBCLone_KNN}, uses the \code{unlabeled_neighbors} field.
\item The function extracts the feature matrix rows corresponding to the nearest neighbors of the specified sample,
and plots a heatmap of features with nonzero values.

\examples{
# Assuming 'model' is a DLBCLone model and 'sample_id' is a valid sample:
nearest_neighbor_heatmap(sample_id, model)
