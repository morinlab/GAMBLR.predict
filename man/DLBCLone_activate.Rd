\title{Activate a DLBCLone model by embedding its training set once}
\usage{
DLBCLone_activate(
  optimized_model,
  seed = 12345,
  force = FALSE,
  store_labeled = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{optimized_model}{A DLBCLone optimized model (list) that contains at least
$model (frozen uwot model), $features (training feature matrix with rownames),
$df (training metadata incl. sample_id and labels), $best_params$na_option,
and $truth_column.}

\item{seed}{Integer seed for reproducibility (passed to make_and_annotate_umap).}

\item{force}{Logical; if TRUE, recompute even if projection is already present.}

\item{store_labeled}{Logical; if TRUE, also store a pre-joined
\code{projection_train_labeled} with coordinates + truth labels.}
}
\value{
The same \code{optimized_model} list with \verb{$projection_train} added (and
optionally \verb{$projection_train_labeled}). Each are data frames containing the
UMAP coordinates for the training samples, joined to \code{sample_id} and (if
requested) the truth labels, in the latter.
}
\description{
Computes the UMAP projection for the model's training features and stores
it inside the model object as \code{projection_train}. If already present and
\code{force = FALSE}, returns the model unchanged.
