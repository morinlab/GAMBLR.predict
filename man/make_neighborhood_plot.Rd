\usage{
make_neighborhood_plot(
  single_sample_prediction_output,
  this_sample_id,
  prediction_in_title = TRUE,
  add_circle = TRUE,
  label_column = "DLBCLone_wo",
  point_size = 0.5,
  point_alpha = 0.9,
  line_alpha = 0.9
)
}
\arguments{
\item{single_sample_prediction_output}{A list containing prediction
results and annotation data frames.
Must include elements \code{prediction} (data frame with prediction
results) and \code{anno_df} (data frame with UMAP coordinates and
annotations).}

\item{this_sample_id}{Character. The sample ID for which the neighborhood
plot will be generated.}

\item{prediction_in_title}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, includes the predicted
label in the plot title.}

\item{add_circle}{Plot will include a circle surrounding the set of
neighbors. Set to FALSE to disable.}

\item{label_column}{Specify the column that contains the DLBCLone
prediction you want to show.
Default: the optimized Other-balanced "DLBCLone_wo".}

\item{point_size}{Numeric. The size of the points in the plot.
Default: 0.5.}

\item{point_alpha}{Numeric. The transparency level of the points
in the plot. Default: 0.9.}

\item{line_alpha}{Numeric. The transparency level of the lines
connecting the sample to its neighbors. Default: 0.9.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} object representing the UMAP plot with
the selected sample and its neighbors highlighted.
}
\description{
Generates a UMAP plot highlighting the neighborhood of a given sample,
showing its nearest neighbors and their group assignments.
}
\details{
The function extracts the nearest neighbors of the specified sample,
draws segments connecting the sample to its neighbors, and colors
points by group (e.g., lymphgen subtype). The plot title can optionally
include the predicted label.

# Assuming 'pred_output' is the result of DLBCLone_predict_single_sample
# on sample_id "DLBCL10951T".
